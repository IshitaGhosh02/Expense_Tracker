# Expense_Tracker
The Expense Tracker allows users to add expenses by filling out a form that includes the expense name, amount, category, and date. 
When submitted, the expense is added to a list displayed in a table below.
The total amount is automatically updated to reflect all expenses. 
Users can filter expenses by category, and each expense can be edited or deleted.
